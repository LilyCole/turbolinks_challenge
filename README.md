##Instructions

Clone this lab, bundle, and run `rails server`. (This lab does not have a databse!)

#### Challenge 1 - Color Changer

When you click on a color page, your background color should change to match the name of the color in your url path.

- Does it work on refresh?
- Does it work when you click through to the page?
- Is your solution DRY?

#### Challenge 2 - Page View Counter

The counter should increase for every individual page view.

- Do all the numbers reset when you refresh? (good!)
- Do specific numbers increment on each pageview?
- Is your solution DRY?
